# WeatherPi
This is a Java/Python run program to display the current weather. Please install Java, Python, and PyOWM (pip install pyowm) and get an OWM api key to use this.
## Things it can do
### It can take live OWM data from PyOWM and put it into a Java JPanel.
### (coming soon, hence the 0 degree reading for the weather sensor) It can take live data from a weather sensor and put it into a Java JPanel.
